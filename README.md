## Overview

### What is quizie

Quizie is a platform where you can take multiple-choice quizes about different subjects. This platform is based on [The Trivia](https://the-trivia-api.com) quiz API. The Quize users should register first, if they don't already have an account; they can either do so using their email address and a custom password or their Google or Facebook accounts. In case a user already has an account, he/she can easily sign in using their email and password or their Google or Facebook accounts. A user can choose the category (quiz subject), the difficulty level and the number of questions. The Quizie users can also observe their records including the number of correct answers from the total and the percentage of correctness of answers for all categories.
